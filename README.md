# aeryn

The project structure represents a typical python module file strucutre, and is uneccessary to be copied if you are not planning on running as a module from the command line.

If you would like to run this project, you will need to do the following:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Navigate to `aeryn/mini_project`

Create a virtual environment:
```pwsh
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```pwsh
./venv/Scripts/activate
```

Install pygame
```pwsh
pip install pygame
```

You will then be able to run the module, by running the following from `aeryn/mini_project`
```pwsh
python -m mini_project
```
